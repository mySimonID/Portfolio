h2:Detail
p:The three search/filter sections work by processing the initial list of products and passing the result to the next filter.
p:For example the text search could filter anything with 'shoe' in the title, this remaining list would them be passed onto the 'instock' filter and so on.
p:This way, multiple search/filters can easily be created.
p:This project consists of four main files index.html, app.js, data.js and styles.css
*:index.html - is the main UI and effectively splits the page into two columns
*:app.js - is where the main Javascript is held
*:data.js - holds the initial product list.
*:styles.css
